This is the template for how experiments and their output will be structured.

For what data is logged and how, refer to the SudokuIO class.

The dataset consists of 1260 problems, there are 20 possible combinations of hyper-heuristics.
If each problem is run 30 times, the total number of runs required is 756000.
In order to run many experiments and later parse their output, a planned structure for output is necessary.
The solution path of each run will uniquely identify solutions appearing in more general log files that aim to collect
broader data:

_sol.txt                   -      Solution file produced for every run of this script. Its root path is a unique
                                     id that is used as an identifier in sel_log, acc_log, and all_experiments_log.txt.
sel_log.txt, acc_log.txt    -     Selector, acceptor data of each unique run of the problem by the same hyperheuristic
all_experiments_log.txt     -     General output recorded for each puzzle order dataset.
